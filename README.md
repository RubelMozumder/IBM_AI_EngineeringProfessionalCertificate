# IBM_AI_EngineeringProfessionalCertificate
Some of relavant projeccts are included in CapstoneProjects folder. All the notebooks also include the discussion of correspoding topics. Some nootbooks are as follows:

1. [VGG16.ipynb](https://github.com/RubelMozumder/IBM_AI_EngineeringProfessionalCertificate/blob/WorkingOn/CapstoneProjects/KerasVGG16fortwoFoldCategoricalData/VGG16.ipynb) develops VGG16 Keras pretrained model and compares performace with another Keras ResNet50 pretrained model. The models have been applied for two fold categorical data.

2. [RegressionWithScikitLearn](https://github.com/RubelMozumder/IBM_AI_EngineeringProfessionalCertificate/blob/WorkingOn/CapstoneProjects/RegressionWithScikitLearn.Rmd) notebook includes 'K-Nearest Neighbour' classification algorithm for prediction loan default or not.

3. [Regression-With-Deep-Learning-Library-Keras](https://github.com/RubelMozumder/IBM_AI_EngineeringProfessionalCertificate/blob/WorkingOn/CapstoneProjects/Regression-With-Deep-Learning-Library-Keras.ipynb) contains regression with keras that mainly uses fully connected layers for regession.
